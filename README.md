## Hints
Rethink your application from SOLID point of view. Keep in mind that in addition to implementing multithreading, we will also work with the database and http. In many ways, we will repeat what we did for the console application for both the database and the http layers. It might be worth coming up with some common interfaces that different versions will implement.
